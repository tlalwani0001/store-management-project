1. Describe your project.

   - Write your response here: My project runs a coffee shop that shows a set of orders with different items. For example an order for an espresso sets the price, flavor, size, number of shots and if it has milk or not while the mocha class has  similar characteristics just without the shots of espresso and if it has milk, in replace of it, the class asks if you ordered caramel and additional flavors.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Write your response here: Something that I am proud of is that I was able to create this project with less issues than that of the asphalt project.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Write your response here... Something I would do differently if I had the oppertunity to is to use the scanner method and use inputs a person can type. This would improve the other all use of the app.
